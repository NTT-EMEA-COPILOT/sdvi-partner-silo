# Chapter-7: Dispatch Next Steps (Split Or Sequencing)

In Rally, you can dispatch a job to multiple steps in a sequence or split the job into multiple steps. 
This chapter will guide you through the process of dispatching a job to multiple steps in a sequence or splitting the job into multiple steps.

## Dispatching a job to multiple steps in a sequence
In some scenarios, you may run a preset that identifies some dynamic_preset_data that you want to use by a "provider" (other than eval), and may want to preserve that data for the following step.

## Dispatching a job to parallel steps in a split
In some cases, you may be able to optimize your supply chain by parallelizing tasks that don't have any dependence with each other.
