# Chapter-7: Dispatch Next Steps (Split Or Sequencing)

In Rally, you can dispatch a job to multiple steps in a sequence or split the job into multiple steps. 
This chapter will guide you through the process of dispatching a job to multiple steps in a sequence or splitting the job into multiple steps.  

## Dispatching a job to multiple steps in a sequence
In some scenarios, you may run a preset that identifies some dynamic_preset_data that you want to use by a "provider" (other than eval), and may want to preserve that data for the following step.  

## Dispatching a job to parallel steps in a split
In some cases, you may be able to optimize your supply chain by parallelizing tasks that don't have any dependence with each other.  

The official documentation is available [here](https://sdvi.my.site.com/support/s/article/Decision-Engine-Dispatch-Next-Steps-Split-Or-Sequencing).  

The diagram below shows the corresponding representation of the parallel steps example provided in the documentation, within the **SDVI Rally Visualizer**, a tool used to graphically display workflow logic, execution paths, and decision branches as configured in the Rally platform. The purpose of including this visualization is to facilitate the understanding of a supply chain that includes parallel processing steps, making it easier to comprehend how the Decision Engine manages concurrent workflows.
